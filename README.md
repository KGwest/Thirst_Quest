## Overview

**Thirst Quest** is a browser-based mini game created to support the mission of [charity: water](https://www.charitywater.org/), a nonprofit bringing clean and safe drinking water to people in developing countries. This project was developed as part of a college assignment to raise awareness and engage young people through interactive design.

The goal? **Tap 10 clean water drops to fill a virtual bucket before time runs out.**

## Game Mechanics

- **Click/Tap** clean water drops (ðŸ’§) as they fall.
- **Avoid polluted drops** â€” they don't help your progress!
- Each clean drop increases the water level in your bucket by 10%.
- Fill the bucket to 100% before the 30-second timer ends to win!
- If you succeed, you get a celebratory message. Otherwise, you're encouraged to try again.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** â€“ page structure and layout
- **CSS** â€“ styling, animations, and water tank design
- **JavaScript** â€“ falling objects, interaction logic, game timer, and win/loss logic
